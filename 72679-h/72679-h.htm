  <h2 class='c006'>Preface.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>This translation of the <span class='sc'>First Book</span> of the “<i>Lemegeton</i>”
which is now for the first time made accessible to
students of <span class='sc'>Talismanic Magic</span> was done, after careful
collation and edition, from numerous <i>Ancient Manuscripts</i>
in <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Latin</i>, and <i>French</i>, by G. H. <i>Fra.</i>
D.D.C.F., by the order of the <i>Secret Chief</i> of the <i>Rosicrucian
Order</i>.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The G. H. <i>Fra.</i>, having succumbed
unhappily to the assaults of the <i>Four Great Princes</i>
(acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed
expedient that the work should be brought to its conclusion
by another hand. The investigation of a competent
Skryer into the house of our unhappy <i>Fra.</i>, confirmed
this divination; neither our <i>Fra.</i> nor his <i>Hermetic
Mul.</i> were there seen; but only the terrible shapes of the
evil <i>Adepts</i> S.V.A.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and H., whose original bodies having
<a id='Page_4'></a>been sequestered by Justice, were no longer of use to
them. On this we stayed no longer Our Hand; but
withdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the Rota, and the
Books M. and Q. did decide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley,
a poet, and skilled student of <i>Magical Lore</i>, and
an expert <i>Kabbalist</i>, to complete openly that which had
been begun in secret.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> This is that which is written:
“His Bishoprick let another take.” And again: “<i>Oculi
Tetragammaton</i>.” This is also that which is said:
“Nomen Secundum refertur ad <i>Gebhurah</i>; qui est <i>Rex
Bittul</i> atque Corruptio <i>Achurajim Patris et Matris</i> hoc
indigitatur.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And so saying we wish you well.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Goetia <br> The Lesser Key Of Solomon <br> THE INITIATED INTERPRETATION OF CEREMONIAL MAGIC.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>It is loftily amusing to the student of <i>Magical</i> literature
who is not quite a fool—and rare is such a combination!—to
note the criticism directed by the Philistine
against the citadel of his science. Truly, since our childhood
has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the
Bible, but also substantial belief in <i>Alf Laylah</i> wa
<i>Laylah</i>, and only adolescence can cure us, we are only
too liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood,
to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics, to
regard them both on the same level, as interesting documents
from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology,
and as nothing more.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even when we learn that the Bible, by a profound
and minute study of the text, may be forced to yield up
<i>Qabalistic</i> arcana of cosmic scope and importance, we
are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the
companion volume, even if we are the luck holders of
Burton’s veritable edition.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_10'></a>To me, then, it remains to raise the <i>Alf Laylah</i> wa
Laylah into its proper place once more.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all
“<i>magical</i>” phenomena; if they are illusions, they are at
least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily life;
and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least
evidence of some cause.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my
illusion of seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art?</p>

<p class='c005'>Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will
answer: “That cause lies in your brain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>English children (<i>pace</i> the Education Act) are taught
that the Universe lies in infinite Space; Hindu children,
in the Akasa, which is the same thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from
Fichte, that the phenomenal Universe is the creation of
the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under Hindu
Gurus, are told, that by Akasa is meant the Chitakasa.
The Chitakasa is situated in the “Third Eye”, <i>i.e.</i>, in
the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we
can assimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need
to take so much trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all
sense-impressions are dependent on changes in the brain,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
we must include illusions, which are after all sense-impressions
as much as “realities” are, in the class of
“phenomena dependent on brain-changes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Magical phenomena, however, come under a special
sub-class, since they are willed, and their cause is the
series of “real” phenomena called the operations of
ceremonial Magic.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_11'></a>These consist of</p>

<p class='c014'>(1) Sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps,
robes, implements, etc.</p>

<p class='c015'>(2) Sound.</p>

<p class='c015'>The invocations.</p>

<p class='c015'>(3) Smell.</p>

<p class='c015'>The perfumes.</p>

<p class='c015'>(4) Taste.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Sacraments.</p>

<p class='c015'>(5) Touch.</p>

<p class='c015'>As under (1).</p>

<p class='c015'>(6) Mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>The combination of all these and reflection on
their significance.</p>

<p class='c011'>These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual
brain-changes; hence their summary (6) is of unusual
kind. Its projection back into the apparently phenomenal
world is therefore unusual.</p>

<p class='c005'>Herein then consists the reality of the operations and
effects of ceremonial magic,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and I conceive that the
apology is ample, as far as the “effects” refer only to
those phenomena which appear to the magician himself,
the appearance of the spirit, his conversation, possible
shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on
the one hand, and death or madness on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>But can any of the effects described in this our book
Goetia be obtained, and if so, can you give a rational
explanation of the circumstances? Say you so?</p>

<p class='c005'>I can, and will.</p>

<p class='c005'>The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human
brain.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_12'></a>Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer’s projected
cube) methods of stimulating or regulating those
particular spots (through the eye).</p>

<p class='c005'>The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) General control of the brain. (Establishment of
functions relative to the subtle world.)</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>b</i>) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type
of the Spirit.)</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>c</i>) Control of one special portion. (Name of the
Spirit.)</p>

<p class='c005'>The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the
perfume will only tend to control a large area; but there
is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet
enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the
Spirit’s name.</p>

<p class='c005'>I need not enter into more particular discussion of
these points; the intelligent reader can easily fill in what
is lacking.</p>

<p class='c005'>If, then, I say, with Solomon:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,” what I mean is:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical
faculty may be stimulated and developed by following
out the processes called ‘The Invocation of
Cimieries.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>And this is a purely materialistic rational statement;
it is independent of any objective hierarchy at all.
Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can only
suspend judgment, pending a proper and methodical
investigation of the facts alleged.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises
us that we can (1) obtain information; (2) destroy
our enemies; (3) understand the voices of nature; (4)
obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken
<a id='Page_13'></a>these five powers at random; considerations of space forbid
me to explain all.</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious
to note the contrast between the noble means and the
apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter are
disguises for sublime truths. “To destroy our enemies”
is to realize the illusion of duality, to excite compassion.</p>

<p class='c005'>(Ah! Mr. Waite, the world of Magic is a mirror,
wherein who sees muck is muck.)</p>

<p class='c005'>(3) A careful naturalist will understand much from
the voices of the animals he has studied long. Even a
child knows the difference of a cat’s miauling and purring.
The faculty may be greatly developed.</p>

<p class='c005'>(4) Business capacity may be stimulated.</p>

<p class='c005'>(5) Abnormal states of the body may be corrected,
and the involved tissues brought back to tone, in obedience
to currents started from the brain.</p>

<p class='c005'>So for all other phenomena. There is no effect which
is truly and necessarily miraculous.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series
of minute, though of course empirical, physiological experiments,
and whoso will carry them through intelligently
need not fear the result.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have all the health, and treasure, and logic, I need;
I have no time to waste. “There is a lion in the way.”
For me these practices are useless; but for the benefit
of others less fortunate I give them to the world, together
with this explanation of, and apology for, them.</p>

<p class='c005'>I trust that the explanation will enable many students
who have hitherto, by a puerile objectivity in their view
of the question, obtained no results, to succeed; that the
apology may impress upon our scornful men of science
that the study of the bacillus should give place to that
<a id='Page_14'></a>of the baculum, the little to the great—how great one
only realizes when one identifies the wand with the
Mahalingam, up which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000
yojanas a second for 84,000 mahakalpas, down which
Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 croces of yojanas a second
for 84,000 crores of mahakalpas—yet neither reached
an end.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I reach an end.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF MAGIC. <br> <span class='sc'>Lemegeton Vel Clavicula Salomonis Regis.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>Magic is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine
Knowledge of Natural Philosophy,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> advanced in its
works and wonderful operations by a right understanding
of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that
true Agents<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> being applied to proper Patients,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a> strange
and admirable effects will thereby be produced. Whence
magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature;
they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate
an effort,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a
miracle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Origen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain
anything subsisting, but although it should, yet that it
must not be Evil, or subject to contempt or scorn; and
doth distinguish the <i>Natural Magic</i> from that which is
<i>Diabolical</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Apollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the <i>Natural
Magic</i>, by the which he did perform wonderful things.</p>

<p class='c005'>Philo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we
do arrive at the understanding of the Secret Works of
Nature, is so far from being contemptible that the greatest
Monarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay! among
the Persians none might reign unless he was skilful in
this <span class='sc'>Great Art</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_16'></a>This Noble Science often degenerateth, from <i>Natural</i>
becometh <i>Diabolical</i>, and from <i>True Philosophy</i> turneth
unto <i>Nigromancy</i>.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The which is wholly to be charged
upon its followers, who, abusing or not being capable of
that High and Mystical Knowledge do immediately
hearken unto the temptations of <i>Sathan</i>, and are misled
by him into the Study of the <i>Black Art</i>. Hence it is
that Magic lieth under disgrace, and they who seek after
it are vulgarly esteemed <i>Sorcerers</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Fraternity of the Rosie Crusians thought it not
fit to style themselves Magicians, but rather Philosophers.
And they be not ignorant Empiricks,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> but learned and
experienced Physicians, whose remedies be not only
<i>Lawful</i> but <i>Divine</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>(N.B. This is taken from several MS. Codices, of which
the four principal variations are here composed together
in parallel columns as an example of the close agreement
of the various texts of the Lemegeton.</p>

<p class='c005'>For in the whole work the differences in the wording
of the various Codices are not sufficient to require the
constant giving of parallel readings; but except in the
more ancient examples there is much deterioration in
the Seals and Sigils, so that in this latter respect the
more recent exemplars are not entirely reliable.)</p>

<span class='sc'>Almadel</span> or <span class='sc'>Solomon</span>, which containeth those Spirits
which govern the Four Altitudes, or the 360 Degrees of

<p class='c005'>These two last Orders of Spirits are Good, and to

<span class='sc'>Theurgia</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>(5) <span class='sc'>The Fifth Part</span> is a Book of Orations and
Prayers that Wise Solomon used upon the Altar in the
Temple. The which is called <span class='sc'>Ars Nova</span>, which was revealed
unto Solomon by that Holy Angel of God called
<span class='sc'>Michael</span>; and he also received many brief Notes written
with the Finger of God, which were declared to him by
the said Angel with Claps of Thunder; without which
Notes King Solomon had never obtained his great knowledge,
for by them in a short time he knew all Arts and
Sciences both Good and Bad; from these Notes it is
called the <span class='sc'>Notary Art</span>, etc.</p>

Spirits for use in things divers. And hereby did he
acquire great renown.</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) <span class='sc'>The Second Book</span> is one which treateth of
Spirits mingled of Good and Evil Natures, the which is
entitled <span class='sc'>The Theurgia-Goetia</span>, or the Magical Wisdom

those Spirits which be set over the Quaternary of the
Altitudes.</p>

<p class='c005'>These two last mentioned Books, the <span class='sc'>Art Pauline</span> and
the <span class='sc'>Art Almadel</span>, do relate unto Good Spirits alone,
whose knowledge is to be obtained through seeking unto
the Divine. These two Books be also classed together
under the Name of the First and Second Parts of the
Book <span class='sc'>Theurgia of Solomon</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>(5) <span class='sc'>The Fifth Book</span> of the Lemegeton is one of

Art</span>. The which was revealed to him by <span class='sc'>Michael</span>,
that Holy Angel of God, in thunder and in lightning,
and he further did receive by the aforesaid Angel certain
Notes written by the Hand of God, without the which
that Great King had never attained unto his great Wisdom,
for thus he knew all things and all Sciences and
Arts whether Good or Evil.</p>

<a id='Page_24'></a>with four noble Kings and their companies of
great troops. He giveth understanding of the singing
of Birds, and of the Voices of other creatures, such as
the barking of Dogs. He breaketh the Hidden Treasures
open that have been laid by the Enchantments of
Magicians. He is of the Order of Virtues, of which some
part he retaineth still; and he knoweth all things Past,
and to come, and conciliateth Friends and those that be
in Power. He ruleth over 30 Legions of Spirits. His
Seal of Obedience is this, the which wear before thee as

He appeareth in the form of a Man sitting upon a
Dromedary with a Crown most glorious upon his head.
There goeth before him also an Host of Spirits, like Men
with Trumpets and well sounding Cymbals, and all other
sorts of Musical Instruments. He hath a great Voice,
and roareth at his first coming, and his speech is such
that the Magician cannot well understand unless he can
compel him. This Spirit can teach all Arts and Sciences,
and other secret things. He can discover unto thee what
the Earth is, and what holdeth it up in the Waters; and
what Mind is, and where it is; or any other thing thou
mayest desire to know. He giveth Dignity, and confirmeth
the same. He bindeth or maketh any man subject
unto the Magician if he so desire it. He giveth good
Familiars, and such as can teach all Arts. He is to be
observed towards the West. He is of the Order of Dominations.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
He hath under him 200 Legions of Spirits,
and part of them are of the Order of Angels, and the
other part of Potentates. Now if thou callest this Spirit
Paimon alone, thou must make him some offering; and
<a id='Page_25'></a>there will attend him two Kings called <span class='sc'>Labal</span> and
<span class='sc'>Abalim</span>, and also other Spirits who be of the Order of
Potentates in his Host, and 25 Legions. And those
Spirits which be subject unto them are not always with
them unless the Magician do compel them. His Character
is this which must be worn as a Lamen before thee,
etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>(10.) <span class='sc'>Buer.</span>—The Tenth Spirit is Buer, a Great President.
He appeareth in Sagittary, and that is his shape
when the Sun is there. He teaches Philosophy, both
Moral and Natural, and the Logic Art, and also the Virtues
of all Herbs and Plants. He healeth all distempers
in man, and giveth good Familiars. He governeth 50
Legions of Spirits, and his Character of obedience is

<h3 class='c016'>THE MAGIC RING OR DISC OF SOLOMON.</h3>
<p class='c007'>This is the Form of the Magic Ring, or rather Disc, of
Solomon, the figure whereof is to be made in gold or silver.
It is to be held before the face of the exorcist to
preserve him from the stinking sulphurous fumes and
flaming breath of the Evil Spirits.</p>

<p class='c005'>(Colour.—Bright yellow. Letters, black.)</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE VESSEL OF BRASS.</h3>
<p class='c007'>This is the Form of the Vessel of Brass wherein King
Solomon did shut up the Evil Spirits, etc. (<i>See Figures
158 and 159.</i>) (Somewhat different forms are given in
<a id='Page_52'></a>the various codices. The seal in Figure 160 was made in
brass to cover this vessel with at the top. This history
of the genii shut up in the brazen vessel by King Solomon
recalls the story of “The Fisherman and the Jinni”
in “The Arabian Nights.” In this tale, however, there
was only one jinni shut up in a vessel of yellow brass the
which was covered at the top with a leaden seal. This
jinni tells the fisherman that his name is Sakhr, or
Sacar.)</p>

<p class='c005'>(Colour.—Bronze. Letters.—Black on a red band.)</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE SECRET SEAL OF SOLOMON.</h3>
<p class='c007'>This is the Form of the Secret Seal of Solomon, wherewith
he did bind and seal up the aforesaid Spirits with
their legions in the Vessel of Brass.</p>

<p class='c005'>This seal is to be made by one that is clean both inwardly
and outwardly, and that hath not defiled himself
by any woman in the space of a month, but hath in
prayer and fasting desired of God to forgive him all his
sins, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is to be made on the day of Mars or Saturn (Tuesday
or Saturday) at night at 12 o’clock, and written
upon virgin parchment with the blood of a black cock
that never trode hen. Note that on this night the moon
must be increasing in light (<i>i.e.</i>, going from new to full)
and in the Zodiacal Sign of Virgo. And when the seal is
so made thou shalt perfume it with alum, raisins dried
in the sun, dates, cedar and lignum aloes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also, by this seal King Solomon did command all the
aforesaid Spirits in the Vessel of Brass, and did seal it
up with this same seal. He by it gained the love of all
manner of persons, and overcame in battle, for neither
weapons, nor fire, nor water could hurt him. And this
<a id='Page_53'></a>privy seal was made to cover the vessel at the top withal,
etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Note: Figures 162 to 174 inclusive are interesting as
showing a marked resemblance to the central design of
the Secret Seal. It will be observed that the evident
desire is to represent hieroglyphically a person raising
his or her hands in adoration. Nearly all are stone
sepulchral steles, and the execution of them is rough and
primitive in the extreme. Most are in the Musée du
Louvre at Paris.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figures 162 and 163 are from the district of Constantine
and show a figure raising its arms in adoration.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Figure 164, also from Constantine, the person bears
a palm branch in the right hand. Above is a hieroglyphic
representing either the Lunar Disc or the Sun in
the heavens; but more probably the former.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 165 is a more complicated stele. Above is the
symbol already mentioned, then comes the sign of the
Pentagram, represented by a five-pointed star, towards
which the person raises his or her hands. Besides the
latter is a rude form of caduceus. A brief inscription
follows in the Punic character. The Punic or Carthaginian
language is usually considered to have been a
dialect of Phœnician, and Carthage was of course a colony
of Tyre. Beneath the Tunic inscription is a horse’s
head in better drawing than the sculpture of the rest of
the stele, which would seem to imply that the rudeness of
the representation of the human figure is intentional.
This and the following stele are also from Constantine.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Figure 166 again, the horse is best delineated by
far. In addition to the other symbols there is either a
hand or a foot, for it is almost impossible to distinguish
which, at the head of the stele, followed by an egg-and-tongue
moulding. The figure of the person with the
<a id='Page_54'></a>arms raised is treated as a pure hieroglyphic and is
placed between two rude caducei. The Lunar or Solar
Symbol follows.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 167, also from Constantine, shows the last-mentioned
symbol above. The figure with the arms raised
is simply a hieroglyph, and is placed between an arm and
hand on the one side, and a rude caduceus on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 168 shows the person holding a rude caduceus
in the right hand, and standing above a dolphin. This
latter, as in the case of the horse in 165 and 166, is by
far the best delineated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 169, this also being from Constantine, shows
the usual human hieroglyph between a caduceus and a
crescent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 170 is from the site of ancient Carthage. It
is very rough in workmanship, and the designs are mere
scratchings on the stone. The <i>ensemble</i> has the effect of
an evil Sigil.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 171 is also from Carthage and the various symbols
appear to have become compressed into and synthesised
in the form of a peculiarly evil-looking caduceus.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 172 is from the decoration of a sepulchral urn
found at Oldenburgh in Germany. It is remarkable as
showing the same hieroglyphic human form with the
crescent above; the latter in the Secret Seal of Solomon
has a flattened top, and is therefore more like a bowl,
and is placed across the hieroglyph.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 173 is an Egyptian design which would show
an analogy between the symbol and the idea of the force
of the creation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure 174 is a stele from Phœnicia somewhat similar
to the others, except that the rudimentary caducei in
Figures 166 and 170 are here replaced by two roughly
drawn Ionic columns.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_55'></a>These last three designs are taken from the work of
the Chevalier Emile Soldi-Colbert de Beaulieu, on the
“<i>Langue Sacrée</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In Figure 175 is given the Seal of the Spirit <span class='sc'>Halahel</span>.
This Spirit is said to be under the rule of <span class='sc'>Bael</span>, and to
be of a mixed nature, partly good and partly evil, like
the spirits of Theurgia-Goetia which follow in the second
book of the Lemegeton.</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE OTHER MAGICAL REQUISITES.</h3>
<p class='c007'>The other magical requisites are: a sceptre, a sword, a
mitre, a cap, a long white robe of linen, and other garments
for the purpose;<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a> also a girdle of lion’s skin three
inches broad, with all the names written about it which
be round the outmost part of the Magical Circle. Also
perfumes, and a chafing-dish of charcoal kindled to put
the fumes on, to smoke or perfume the place appointed
for action; also anointing oil to anoint thy temples and
thine eyes with; and fair water to wash thyself in. And
in so doing, thou shalt say as David said:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Adoration at the Bath.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>“Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, O Lord! and I
shall be clean: Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter
than snow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And at the putting on of thy garments thou shalt say:
<span class='sc'>The Adoration at the Induing of the Vestments</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the figurative mystery of these holy vestures (or
of this holy vestment) I will clothe me with the armour
of salvation in the strength of the Most High, <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>;
<a id='Page_56'></a><span class='sc'>Amacor</span>; <span class='sc'>Amides</span>; <span class='sc'>Theodinias</span>; <span class='sc'>Anitor</span>; that my desired
end may be effected through Thy strength, O
<span class='sc'>Adonai</span>! unto Whom the praise and glory will for ever
and ever belong! Amen!”</p>

<p class='c005'>After thou hast so done, make prayers unto God according
unto thy work, as Solomon hath commanded.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE CONJURATION TO CALL FORTH ANY OF THE AFORESAID SPIRITS.</h3>
<p class='c007'>I do invocate and conjure thee, O Spirit, N.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a>; and
being with power armed from the <span class='sc'>Supreme Majesty</span>, I
do strongly command thee, by <span class='sc'>Beralanensis</span>, <span class='sc'>Baldachiensis</span>,
<span class='sc'>Paumachia</span>, and <span class='sc'>Apologiae Sedes</span>; by the most
Powerful Princes, Genii, Liachidæ, and Ministers of the
Tartarean Abode; and by the Chief Prince of the Seat
of Apologia in the Ninth Legion, I do invoke thee, and
by invocating conjure thee. And being armed with
power from the <span class='sc'>Supreme Majesty</span>, I do strongly command
thee, by Him Who spake and it was done, and unto
whom all creatures be obedient. Also I, being made after
the image of <span class='sc'>God</span>, endued with power from <span class='sc'>God</span> and
created according unto His will, do exorcise thee by
that most mighty and powerful name of <span class='sc'>God</span>, <span class='sc'>El</span>, strong
and wonderful; O thou Spirit N. And I command thee
and Him who spake the Word and <span class='sc'>His Fiat</span> was accomplished,
and by all the names of God. Also by the names
<span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, <span class='sc'>El</span>, <span class='sc'>Elohim</span>, <span class='sc'>Elohi</span>, <span class='sc'>Ehyeh</span>, <span class='sc'>Asher Ehyeh</span>,

God Most High</span>, I do exorcise thee and do powerfully
command thee, O thou Spirit N., that thou dost forthwith
<a id='Page_57'></a>appear unto me here before this Circle in a fair
human shape, without any deformity or tortuosity. And
by this ineffable name, <span class='sc'>Tetragrammaton Iehovah</span>, do I
command thee, at the which being heard the elements
are overthrown, the air is shaken, the sea runneth back,
the fire is quenched, the earth trembleth, and all the hosts
of the celestials, terrestrials, and infernals do tremble
together, and are troubled and confounded. Wherefore
come thou, O Spirit N., forthwith, and without delay,
from any or all parts of the world wherever thou mayest
be, and make rational answers unto all things that I
shall demand of thee. Come thou peaceably, visibly, and
affably, now, and without delay, manifesting that which
I shall desire. For thou art conjured by the name of the
<span class='sc'>Living</span> and <span class='sc'>True God</span>, <span class='sc'>Helioren</span>, wherefore fulfil thou
my commands, and persist thou therein unto the end,
and according unto mine interest, visibly and affably
speaking unto me with a voice clear and intelligible without
any ambiguity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Repeat this conjuration as often as thou pleasest, and
if the Spirit come not yet, say as followeth:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE SECOND CONJURATION.</h3>
<p class='c007'>I do invocate, conjure, and command thee, O thou Spirit
N., to appear and to show thyself visibly unto me before
this Circle in fair and comely shape, without any deformity
or tortuosity; by the name and in the name <span class='sc'>Iah</span>
and <span class='sc'>Vau</span>, which Adam heard and spake; and by the
name of <span class='sc'>God</span>, <span class='sc'>Agla</span>, which Lot heard and was saved with
his family; and by the name <span class='sc'>Ioth</span>, which Jacob heard
from the angel wrestling with him, and was delivered
from the hand of Esau his brother; and by the name
<span class='sc'>Anaphaxeton</span> which Aaron heard and spake and was
<a id='Page_58'></a>made wise; and by the name <span class='sc'>Zabaoth</span>, which Moses
named and all the rivers were turned into blood; and by
the name <span class='sc'>Asher Ehyeh Oriston</span>, which Moses named,
and all the rivers brought forth frogs, and they ascended
into the houses, destroying all things; and by the name
<span class='sc'>Elion</span>, which Moses named, and there was great hail
such as had not been since the beginning of the world;
and by the name <span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, which Moses named, and there
came up locusts, which appeared upon the whole land,
and devoured all which the hail had left; and by the
name <span class='sc'>Schema Amathia</span> which Ioshua called upon, and
the sun stayed his course; and by the name <span class='sc'>Alpha</span> and
<span class='sc'>Omega</span>, which Daniel named, and destroyed Bel, and
slew the Dragon; and in the name <span class='sc'>Emmanuel</span>, which the

<span class='sc'>Theos</span>, <span class='sc'>Ictros</span>, <span class='sc'>Athanatos</span>; and by these three secret
names, <span class='sc'>Agla</span>, <span class='sc'>On</span>, <span class='sc'>Tetragrammaton</span>, do I adjure and
constrain thee. And by these names, and by all the other
names of the <span class='sc'>Living</span> and <span class='sc'>True God</span>, the <span class='sc'>Lord Almighty</span>,
I do exorcise and command thee, O Spirit N., even by
Him Who spake the Word and it was done, and to Whom
all creatures are obedient; and by the dreadful judgments
of <span class='sc'>God</span>; and by the uncertain Sea of Glass, which
is before the <span class='sc'>Divine Majesty</span>, mighty and powerful; by
the four beasts before the throne, having eyes before and
behind; by the fire round about the throne; by the holy
angels of Heaven; and by the mighty wisdom of <span class='sc'>God</span>; I
do potently exorcise thee, that thou appearest here before
this Circle, to fulfil my will in all things which shall
<a id='Page_59'></a>seem good unto me; by the Seal of <span class='sc'>Basdathea Baldachia</span>;
and by this name <span class='sc'>Primeumaton</span>, which Moses
named, and the earth opened, and did swallow up Kora,
Dathan, and Abiram. Wherefore thou shalt make faithful
answers unto all my demands, O Spirit N., and shalt
perform all my desires so far as in thine office thou art
capable hereof. Wherefore, come thou, visibly, peaceably,
and affably, now without delay, to manifest that
which I desire, speaking with a clear and perfect voice,
intelligibly, and to mine understanding.</p>

<p class='c005'>If he come not yet at the rehearsal of these two first
conjurations (but without doubt he will), say on as followeth;
it being a constraint:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE CONSTRAINT.</h3>
<p class='c007'>I do conjure thee, O thou Spirit N., by all the most
glorious and efficacious names of the <span class='sc'>Most Great and
Incomprehensible Lord God of Hosts</span>, that thou comest
quickly and without delay from all parts and places of
the earth and world wherever thou mayest be, to make
rational answers unto my demands, and that visibly and
affably, speaking with a voice intelligible unto mine
understanding as aforesaid. I conjure and constrain
thee, O thou Spirit N., by all the names aforesaid; and
in addition by these seven great names wherewith Solomon
the Wise bound thee and thy companions in a Vessel
of Brass, <span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, <span class='sc'>Preyai</span> or <span class='sc'>Prerai</span>, <span class='sc'>Tetragrammaton</span>,
<span class='sc'>Anaphaxeton</span> or <span class='sc'>Anepheneton</span>, <span class='sc'>Inessenfatoal</span> or <span class='sc'>Inessenfatall</span>,
<span class='sc'>Pathtumon</span> or <span class='sc'>Pathatumon</span>, and <span class='sc'>Itemon</span>;
that thou appearest here before this Circle to fulfil my
will in all things that seem good unto me. And if thou
be still so disobedient, and refusest still to come, I will
in the power and by the power of the name of the <span class='sc'>Supreme
and Everlasting Lord God Who</span> created both
<a id='Page_60'></a>thee and me and all the world in six days, and what is
contained therein, <span class='sc'>Eie</span>, <span class='sc'>Saraye</span>, and by the power of this
name <span class='sc'>Primeumaton</span> which commandeth the whole host
of Heaven, curse thee, and deprive thee of thine office,
joy, and place, and bind thee in the depths of the Bottomless
Pit or Abyss, there to remain unto the Day of the
Last Judgment. And I will bind thee in the Eternal
Fire, and into the Lake of Flame and of Brimstone,
unless thou comest quickly and appearest here before
this Circle to do my will. Therefore, come thou! in and
by the holy names <span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, <span class='sc'>Zabaoth</span>, <span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, <span class='sc'>Amioran</span>.
Come thou! for it is <span class='sc'>Adonai</span> who commandest thee.</p>

<p class='c005'>If thou hast come thus far, and yet he appeareth not,
thou mayest be sure that he is sent unto some other place
by his King, and cannot come; and if it be so, invocate
the King as here followeth, to send him. But if he do
not come still, then thou mayest be sure that he is bound
in chains in hell, and that he is not in the custody of his
King. If so, and thou still hast a desire to call him even
from thence, thou must rehearse the general curse which
is called the Spirits’ Chain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here followeth, therefore, the Invocation of the King:<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE INVOCATION OF THE KING.</h3>
<p class='c007'>O thou great, powerful, and mighty <span class='sc'>King Amaimon</span>,
who bearest rule by the power of the <span class='sc'>Supreme God El</span>
over all spirits both superior and inferior of the Infernal
Orders in the Dominion of the East; I do invocate and
command thee by the especial and true name of God;
and by that God that Thou Worshippest; and by the
Seal of thy creation; and by the most mighty and powerful
name of <span class='sc'>God</span>, <span class='sc'>Iehovah Tetragrammaton</span> who cast
<a id='Page_61'></a>thee out of heaven with all other infernal spirits; and
by all the most powerful and great names of <span class='sc'>God</span> who
created Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and all things in
them contained; and by their power and virtue; and by
the name <span class='sc'>Primeumaton</span> who commandeth the whole host
of Heaven; that thou mayest cause, enforce, and compel
the Spirit N. to come unto me here before this Circle in
a fair and comely shape, without harm unto me or unto
any other creature, to answer truly and faithfully unto
all my requests; so that I may accomplish my will and
desire in knowing or obtaining any matter or thing
which by office thou knowest is proper for him to perform
or accomplish, through the power of <span class='sc'>God</span>, <span class='sc'>El</span>, Who created
and doth dispose of all things both celestial, aërial,
terrestrial, and infernal.</p>

<p class='c005'>After thou shalt have invocated the King in this manner
twice or thrice over, then conjure the spirit thou
wouldst call forth by the aforesaid conjurations, rehearsing
them several times together, and he will come
without doubt, if not at the first or second time of rehearsing.
But if he do not come, add the “Spirits’
Chain” unto the end of the aforesaid conjurations, and
he will be forced to come, even if he be bound in chains,
for the chains must break off from him, and he will be
at liberty:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE GENERAL CURSE, CALLED THE SPIRITS’ CHAIN, AGAINST ALL SPIRITS THAT REBEL.</h3>
<p class='c007'>O thou wicked and disobedient spirit N., because thou
hast rebelled, and hast not obeyed nor regarded my words
which I have rehearsed; they being all glorious and
incomprehensible names of the true <span class='sc'>God</span>, the maker and
<a id='Page_62'></a>creator of thee and of me, and of all the world; I do
by the power of these names the which no creature is
able to resist, curse thee into the depth of the Bottomless
Abyss, there to remain unto the Day of Doom in chains,
and in fire and brimstone unquenchable, unless thou
forthwith appear here before this Circle, in this triangle
to do my will. And, therefore, come thou quickly and
peaceably, in and by these names of <span class='sc'>God</span>, <span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, <span class='sc'>Zabaoth</span>,
<span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, <span class='sc'>Amioran</span>; come thou! come thou! for it
is the King of Kings, even <span class='sc'>Adonai</span>, who commandeth
thee.</p>

<p class='c005'>When thou shalt have rehearsed thus far, but still he
cometh not, then write thou his seal on parchment and
put thou it into a strong black box;<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a> with brimstone,
assafœtida, and such like things that bear a stinking
smell; and then bind the box up round with an iron wire,
and hang it upon the point of thy sword, and hold it
over the fire of charcoal; and say as followeth unto the
fire first, it being placed toward that quarter whence the
Spirit is to come:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE CONJURATION OF THE FIRE.</h3>
<p class='c007'>I conjure thee, O fire, by him who made thee and all
other creatures for good in the world, that thou torment,
burn, and consume this Spirit N., for everlasting. I
condemn thee, thou Spirit N., because thou art disobedient
and obeyest not my commandment, nor keepest the
precepts of the <span class='sc'>Lord thy God</span>, neither wilt thou obey
me nor mine invocations, having thereby called thee
forth, I, who am the servant of the <span class='sc'>Most High and
Imperial Lord God of Hosts, Iehovah</span>, I who am dignified
<a id='Page_63'></a>and fortified by His celestial power and permission,
and yet thou comest not to answer these my propositions
here made unto thee. For the which thine averseness
and contempt thou art guilty of great disobedience and
rebellion, and therefore shall I excommunicate thee, and
destroy thy name and seal, the which I have enclosed in
this box; and shall burn thee in the immortal fire and
bury thee in immortal oblivion; unless thou immediately
come and appear visibly and affably, friendly and courteously
here unto me before this Circle, in this triangle,
in a form comely and fair, and in no wise terrible, hurtful,
or frightful to me or any other creature whatsoever
upon the face of earth. And thou shalt make rational
answers unto my requests, and perform all my desires
in all things, that I shall make unto thee.</p>

<p class='c005'>And if he come not even yet, thou shalt say as
followeth:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE GREATER CURSE.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a></h3>
<p class='c007'>Now, O thou Spirit N., since thou art still pernicious
and disobedient, and wilt not appear unto me to answer
unto such things as I would have desired of thee, or
would have been satisfied in; I do in the name, and by
the power and dignity of the Omnipresent and Immortal
Lord God of Hosts <span class='sc'>Iehovah Tetragrammaton</span>, the only
creator of Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and all that is
therein, who is the marvellous Disposer of all things
both visible and invisible, curse thee, and deprive thee of
all thine office, joy, and place; and I do bind thee in the
depths of the Bottomless Abyss there to remain until the
Day of Judgment, I say into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone
<a id='Page_64'></a>which is prepared for all rebellious, disobedient,
obstinate, and pernicious spirits. Let all the company
of Heaven curse thee! Let the sun, moon, and all the
stars curse thee! Let the <span class='sc'>Light</span> and all the hosts of
Heaven curse thee into the fire unquenchable, and into
the torments unspeakable. And as thy name and seal
contained in this box chained and bound up, shall be
choken in sulphurous stinking substances, and burned in
this material fire; so in the name <span class='sc'>Iehovah</span> and by the
power and dignity of these three names, <span class='sc'>Tetragrammaton</span>,
<span class='sc'>Anaphaxeton</span>, and <span class='sc'>Primeumaton</span>, I do cast
thee, O thou wicked and disobedient Spirit N., into the
Lake of Fire which is prepared for the damnéd and accurséd
spirits, and there to remain unto the day of doom,
and never more to be remembered before the face of
God, who shall come to judge the quick, and the dead,
and the world, by fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the exorcist must put the box into the fire, and
by-and-by the Spirit will come, but as soon as he is come,
quench the fire that the box is in, and make a sweet perfume,
and give him welcome and a kind entertainment,
showing unto him the Pentacle that is at the bottom of
your vesture covered with a linen cloth, saying:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE ADDRESS UNTO THE SPIRIT UPON HIS COMING.</h3>
<p class='c007'>Behold thy confusion if thou refusest to be obedient!
Behold the Pentacle of Solomon which I have brought
here before thy presence! Behold the person of the
exorcist in the midst of the exorcism; him who is arméd
by God and without fear; him who potently invocateth
thee and calleth thee forth unto appearance; even him,
thy master, who is called <span class='sc'>Octinimos</span>. Wherefore make
<a id='Page_65'></a>rational answer unto my demands, and prepare to be
obedient unto thy master in the name of the Lord:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Bathal or Vathat Rushing upon Abrac!</span></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Abeor coming upon Aberer!</span><a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Then he or they will be obedient, and bid thee ask
what thou wilt, for he or they be subjected by God to
fulfil our desires and commands. And when he or they
shall have appeared and showed himself or themselves
humble and meek, then shalt thou rehearse:</p>
<h3 class='c016'>THE WELCOME UNTO THE SPIRIT.</h3>
<p class='c007'>Welcome Spirit N., O most noble king<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a> (or kings)! I
say thou art welcome unto me, because I have called thee
through Him who has created Heaven, and Earth, and
Hell, and all that is in them contained, and because also
thou hast obeyed. By that same power by the which I
have called thee forth, I bind thee, that thou remain
affably and visibly here before this Circle (or before this
Circle and in this triangle) so constant and so long as I
shall have occasion for thy presence; and not to depart
without my license until thou hast duly and faithfully
performed my will without any falsity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then standing in the midst of the Circle, thou shall
stretch forth thine hand in a gesture of command and
say:</p>

<p class='c005'>“<span class='sc'>By the Pentacle of Solomon have I called thee!
Give unto me a true Answer.</span>”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then let the exorcist state his desires and requests.</p>

<p class='c005'>And when the evocation is finished thou shalt license
the Spirit to depart thus:</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_66'></a>
  <h3 class='c016'>THE LICENSE TO DEPART.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'>O thou Spirit N., because thou hast diligently answered
unto my demands, and hast been very ready and willing
to come at my call, I do here license thee to depart unto
thy proper place; without causing harm or danger unto
man or beast. Depart, then, I say, and be thou very
ready to come at my call, being duly exorcised and conjured
by the sacred rites of magic. I charge thee to
withdraw peaceably and quietly, and the peace of <span class='sc'>God</span>
be ever continued between thee and me! <span class='sc'>Amen!</span></p>

<p class='c005'>After thou hast given the Spirit license to depart,
thou art not to go out of the circle until he or they be
gone, and until thou shalt have made prayers and rendered
thanks unto God for the great blessings He hath
bestowed upon thee in granting thy desires, and delivering
thee from all the malice of the enemy the devil.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also note! Thou mayest command these spirits into
the Vessel of Brass in the same manner as thou dost into
the triangle, by saying: “that thou dost forthwith appear
before this Circle, in this Vessel of Brass, in a fair and
comely shape,” etc., as hath been shown in the fore-going
conjurations.</p>

Liachidae and ministers of the House of Death:
and by the Chief Prince of the seat of Apologia in
the Ninth Legion, I do invoke thee and by invoking
conjure thee. And being exalted above ye in
the power of the Most High, I say unto thee, Obey!
in the name of him who spake and it was, to whom
all creatures and things obey. Moreover I, whom
God made in the likeness of God, who is the creator
according to his living breath, stir thee up in
the name which is the voice of wonder of the mighty
God, El, strong and unspeakable, O thou Spirit N.
<a id='Page_73'></a>And I say to thee obey, in the name of him who

Most High, I stir thee up; and in our strength I
say Obey! O Spirit N. Appear unto His servants

a man; and visit me in peace. And in the ineffable
name Tetragrammaton Iehovah, I say, Obey!
whose mighty sound being exalted in power the
pillars are divided, the winds of the firmament
groan aloud; the fire burns not; the earth moves
in earthquakes; and all things of the house of
heaven and earth and the dwelling-place of darkness
are as earthquakes, and are in torment, and
are confounded in thunder. Come forth, O Spirit
N. in a moment: let thy dwelling-place be empty,
apply unto us the secrets of Truth and obey my
power. Come forth, visit us in peace, appear unto
my eyes; be friendly: Obey the living breath! For
I stir thee up in the name of the God of Truth

pleasant deliverers unto him and his house and
in the name Ioth which Iacob spake in the voice
<a id='Page_74'></a>of the Holy ones who cast him down, and it was
also as pleasant deliverers in the anger of his
brother and in the name Anaphaxeton, which
Aaron spake and it was as the Secret Wisdom and
in the name Zabaoth which Mosheh spake, and all
things of water were as blood; and in the name
Asher Ehyeh Oriston, which Mosheh spake, and
all waters were bringing forth creatures who wax
strong, which lifted up unto the houses, which
destroy all things and in the name of Elion which
Mosheh spake, and it was as stones from the firmament
of wrath, such as was not in the ages of
Time the beginning of the Earth and in the name
of Adni, which Mosheh spake and there appeared
creatures of earth who destroyed what the big
stones did not: and in the name Schema Amathia,
which Ioshua invoked, and the Sun remained over
ye, O ye hills the seats of Gibeon, and in the names
Alpha and Omega which Daniel spake, and destroyed
Bel and the Dragon: and in the name
Emmanuel which the sons of God sang praises in
the midst of the burning plain, and flourished in
conquest: and in the name Hagios, and by the
Throne of Adni, and in Ischyros, Athanatos,
Paracletos: and in O Theos, Ictros, Athanatos.

all creatures are obedient and in the Extreme Justice

just Glory of the Throne; by the Holy ones of

circle; obey in all things that I say; in the seal
Basdathea Baldachia; and in this Name Primeumaton,
which Mosheh spake, and the earth was
divided, and Korah, Dathan, and Abiram fell in
the depth. Therefore obey in all things, O spirit

<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&#160;&#160;</span><i>Mr. A. E. Waite</i> writes (“<i>Real History Of The Rosicrucians</i>,”
p. 426): “I beg leave to warn my readers that all persons who
proclaim themselves to be <i>Rosicrucians</i> are simply members of
pseudo-fraternities, and that there is that difference between their
assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of a lie
consists!” It is within the <i>Editor’s</i> personal knowledge that Mr.
Waite was (and still is probably) a member of a society claiming
to be the R.C. fraternity. As <i>Mr. Waite</i> constantly hints in his
writing that he is in touch with initiated centres, I think the
<i>syllogism</i>, whose premises are given above, is fair, if not quite
formal.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

and giving up the <i>Arcana</i> of our <i>Fraternity</i> into so unhallowed a
power, that We decided no longer to leave Our dignity and authority
in the hands of one who could be thus easily imposed upon.
(For by a childish and easy magical trick did S.V.A. persuade
D.D.C.F. of that lie.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The coiled serpent is only shown in one private codex, the
Hebrew names being in most cases simply written round in a
somewhat spiral arrangement within the double circle. It is to be
remembered that Hebrew is always written from right to left,
instead of from left to right like ordinary European languages.
The small Maltese crosses are placed to mark the conclusion of
each separate set of Hebrew names. These names are those of
Deity Angels and Archangels allotted by the Qabalists to each of
the 9 first Sephiroth or Divine Emanations. In English letters they
run thus, beginning from the head of the serpent: + Ehyeh
Kether Metatron Chaioth Ha-Qadehs Rashith Ha-Galgalim S.P.M.
(for “Sphere of the Primum Mobile”) + Iah Chokmah
Ratziel Auphanim Masloth S.S.F (for “Sphere of the Fixed
Stars,” or S.Z. for “Sphere of the Zodiac”) + Iehovah Eolhim
Binah Tzaphquiel Aralim Shabbathai S. (for “Sphere”) of
Saturn + El Chesed Tzadquiel Chaschmalim Tzedeq S. of Jupiter
+ Elohim Gibor Geburah Kamael Seraphim Madim S. of Mars +
Iehovah Eloah Va-Daäth Tiphereth Raphaēl Malakim Shemesh S.
